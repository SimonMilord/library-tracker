## Library tracker

Simple application to keep track of books to read and read already.

This was done as part of the odin project.

I practiced the following:
  - Modals in HTML/CSS
  - JS DOM manipulation
  - Objects and constructors in JS
  
  Next steps:
  
  - add backend to save the data
  - add authentication
